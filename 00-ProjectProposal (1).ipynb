    "Health outcomes vary across the United States and are influenced by a combination of biological and lifestyle factors. Conditions like diabetes, obesity, and mental health is not attributed to a single cause. Factors like genetics, medical conditions, access to healthcare and the daily routine of an individual all play a role. One thing we can say about is that physical activity is one of the factors that can easily improve such conditions when time is dedicated to it weekly, and our goal is to examine how physical activity is associated with adult obesity prevalence, diabetes prevalence, and mental health across the U.S.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Physical activity plays an important role in maintaining both physical and mental health and it is recognized as an important health factor. Physical activity includes everyday movements such as walking, running, stretching, or even having a structured workout. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), individuals should engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate to intense physical activity per week to support health outcomes <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">1</a>. Despite the recommendations from this organization, the amount of time or levels of physical activity varies across the individuals in the U.S. due to the differences they have in their work schedules, access to resources, and personal life.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous research has shown the relationship between physical activity and its health outcomes, such as obesity and diabetes. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that obesity and diabetes prevalence has steadily increased across the U.S. over the past decades <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">2</a>. We noticed that these trends are influenced by a variety of factors which include diet quality, limited physical activity, metabolic conditions like thyroid conditions, or even the individual's metabolism. However, in this project, we focus on physical activity as the key variable and examine how it is associated with obesity and diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving along with physical health, there is also prior work that examined the relationship between physical activity and mental health outcomes. Research from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that even modest amounts of physical activity, such as 15 minutes of exercise per day or even one hour of walking, is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of major depression <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">3</a>. This supports the inclusion of mental health as an outcome variable in our project, along with obesity and diabetes when we examine how physical activity varies across the U.S. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our group has noticed that the existing research focuses more on the mental and health benefits for an individual. Our goal is to show how physical activity helps in a broader geographic level  which is in the U.S. The differences in physical activity rates across the states may help explain the observed variation in obesity prevalence, diabetes prevalence and mental health indicators. This project aims to identify patterns that may help inform public health strategies and highlight the disparities in health and mental outcomes related to physical activity.\n",

    "Ideal dataset (one per health outcome; we plan to synthesize three datasets)\n",
    "- Core purpose: measure the association between minutes of physical activity and (a) diabetes status, (b) obesity (BMI / body-fat), and (c) self-reported mood / mental-health score.\n",
    "- Required variables (per observation / participant):\n",
    "  1. Unique participant ID (non-identifying)\n",
    "  2. Timestamp / survey date and U.S. state (for aggregation & linkage)\n",
    "  3. Physical activity: minutes of activity per day or per week (numeric). Ideally split by intensity (light/moderate/vigorous) and, optionally, a free-text/activity-type field.\n",
    "  4. Height and weight (to compute BMI) and/or body fat percentage\n",
    "  5. Clinical/diagnostic label or outcome variable:\n",
    "     - Diabetes dataset: diabetes diagnosis (none / prediabetes / diabetes) and, if available, lab measures (A1C, fasting glucose)\n",
    "     - Obesity dataset: measured BMI or body-fat percentage and categories (normal/overweight/obese)\n",
    "     - Mental health dataset: validated self-report score (e.g., PHQ-9, GAD-7, or composite mood score)\n",
    "  6. Key covariates: age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic indicator (education/income), smoking status, and comorbidities or medication use\n",
    "  7. (Optional) Device/source metadata (self-report vs. wearable) and sampling method notes\n",
    "- Minimum sample size: at least 10,000 independent observations per outcome dataset to ensure statistical power and permit subgroup analyses (e.g., by age, sex, or state).\n",
    "- How collected: prospective clinical/epidemiological studies or large-scale national surveys carried out in the U.S., or repositories of wearable-device studies where participants consented to research use. Measurement should be standardized (e.g., validated survey items or device-calibrated minutes) and accompanied by documentation describing sampling frame and inclusion/exclusion criteria.\n",
    "- Storage & organization: CSV / Parquet tables with one row per participant-observation, a data dictionary (README) describing each field, and separate metadata files with provenance and access requirements. Use normalized keys to enable linking state-level covariates or external population measures. Keep raw data read-only and produce a cleaned analysis dataset with versioned scripts (Jupyter / Python notebooks) so every transformation is reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real datasets that could be useful (short descriptions and important variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Fitness/device-based activity linked to BMI and steps — JMIR wearable study  \n",
    "- Where: Study published in JMIR describing Fitbit-derived daily steps and minutes by intensity for ~13,947 consenting U.S. participants; access to underlying research data may require application/permission through the study’s data access channel or affiliated research program.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)  \n",
    "- Important variables: daily step counts; minutes per day of sedentary/light/moderate/vigorous activity; participant age, weight, height, BMI; timestamps. This dataset matches our ideal activity measurement (minutes/day and intensity) and contains measured anthropometrics, making it a strong candidate for the obesity/physical-activity analysis. Access may require data-use permission.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) — state-level physical activity and health indicators  \n",
    "- Where: The CDC BRFSS provides annual, state-representative survey data for U.S. adults and is publicly available from the CDC; BRFSS includes large sample sizes (hundreds of thousands of respondents across years) and state identifiers for aggregation.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)  \n",
    "- Important variables: self-reported physical activity (some years include minutes/week or frequency), diagnosed diabetes (yes/no), BMI (derived from self-reported height and weight), demographic variables (age, sex, race, education, income), and state. BRFSS data are ideal for state-level analyses and for building large-sample diabetes/obesity datasets, though activity measures may be self-reported and sometimes categorical rather than precise minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) — measured anthropometrics, biomarkers, and activity modules  \n",
    "- Where: NHANES provides measured height/weight, biomarkers (A1C, glucose), and in some cycles accelerometer or questionnaire-based physical-activity modules; data are publicly available via CDC with rich documentation and the possibility to combine multiple cycles to increase sample size.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)  \n",
    "- Important variables: objectively measured height and weight (BMI), lab measures relevant to diabetes (A1C, fasting glucose), self-reported or device-measured physical activity (minutes by intensity in some modules), and demographics. NHANES’ measured outcomes increase validity, and pooling cycles can approach the sample-size goals for some analyses; however, sample design and weights must be handled properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Diabetes health indicators (Kaggle mirror of CDC survey-derived dataset) — alexteboul / Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset  \n",
    "- Where: A Kaggle dataset aggregating CDC survey indicators (mirror on Kaggle). The dataset is openly accessible on Kaggle but may carry the caveat that some fields are preprocessed for Kaggle use; review original documentation if using it for publication-quality work.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4)  \n",
    "- Important variables: diabetes diagnosis (binary or multiclass), BMI or weight/height, smoking and other risk factors. This dataset has very large n (hundreds of thousands when derived from CDC sources) and is immediately useful for diabetes risk-factor analyses, but its physical-activity field is binary (any activity in the past 30 days), which does not match our ideal minutes-based activity variable; it can still provide useful covariate and outcome modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Mental health × physical activity (Kaggle dataset by Safiya Fatima)  \n",
    "- Where: Kaggle user dataset that includes weekly physical activity time and mental-health indicators; data are available on Kaggle and can be downloaded after agreeing to Kaggle’s terms.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5)  \n",
    "- Important variables: reported minutes of exercise per week, occupation, and several mental-health related columns. This dataset directly reports weekly exercise time (close to our minutes-per-week ideal) and mental-health measures; however, the dataset is relatively small and contains missing values in text/activity-type fields, so it will require cleaning. We plan to use such a dataset in combination with larger, complementary sources to improve statistical power and generalizability.\n",
    "\n",
    "How we will combine and use these resources\n",
    "- Prioritize datasets that contain minutes-based activity measures (device-derived or validated self-report) for the primary exposure variable. For outcomes where minutes are unavailable (e.g., certain BRFSS variables), use them as supplementary/state-level confirmatory analyses and be explicit about measurement differences.  \n",
    "- Use NHANES and device-based cohorts where available for analyses that require measured anthropometrics or biomarkers. Use BRFSS and large survey-derived datasets for state-level aggregation and to ensure coverage of all U.S. states. When combining, harmonize variables (e.g., convert activity to minutes/week, compute BMI consistently), document all transformations, and use sample weights when required by survey design.\n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not use any human-subject interaction or individual-level data for this project, thus no informed consent is required. All analysis is performed at aggregated (U.S. state) level using publicly available, non-interactive data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have acknowledged that the underlying datasets may reflect collection and survey biases (e.g., nonresponse, sampling bias). We will document known limitations of each dataset and avoid over-interpreting state-level aggregates where collection bias may distort the results.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets used are at the state-aggregate level and contain no personally identifiable information. We will not attempt to merge data in ways that could reconstruct individual identities.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some data sources include demographic variables that allow subgroup comparisons. While our primary analysis is state-level, we recognize that aggregation can conceal disparities. We will note these limitations and, where possible, examine demographic breakdowns to identify patterns that aggregate measures might hide.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "All datasets are publicly available and non-sensitive, but we will store copies on password-protected personal and institutional systems and follow standard security practices to reduce risk of unauthorized access.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    "No individual-level personal data are collected or stored. Because no PII is used, a right-to-be-forgotten mechanism is not required; nevertheless, we will delete any derived files if requested and as described in our retention plan.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not plan to retain the project beyond the course. All project files and data will be deleted after the course concludes, unless the team agrees to preserve a cleaned, anonymized copy for future educational purposes and documents that decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "We acknowledge that state-level analyses miss local and marginalized perspectives. We will explicitly call out these blindspots in our write-up and interpret findings conservatively, avoiding claims about individual-level causation.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will examine missingness patterns, consistency across states, and known survey biases (e.g., recall bias, social desirability) and document these issues. Where feasible, we will avoid analyses that amplify biased signals and will be transparent about remaining biases.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "All visualizations and statistics will be produced to accurately reflect the data and the uncertainty in estimates; we will include appropriate labels, scales, and caveats so readers are not misled.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "No PII will be used or displayed in any analysis or figures.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will document all data cleaning, merging, and analysis steps and provide code and notes to enable reproducibility and auditing of our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "We considered whether physical activity and health outcomes could act as proxies for socioeconomic status or access to care and will interpret associations cautiously, avoiding language that blames individuals or states for structural disparities.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because our analysis is at the state-aggregate level, fairness testing across individual demographic groups is limited. Where subgroup data are available, we will report descriptive comparisons and caveat the limitations of such comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have not defined modeling metrics for a deployed decision system; this item is not applicable for our current exploratory/state-level analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Not applicable for a deployed decision model; we will, however, ensure that any statistical models used are interpretable and that we explain key relationships in plain language.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explicitly communicate limitations of our analysis and potential biases in the report and presentation to avoid overgeneralization or misuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is exploratory and not intended for deployment in decision-making. If outputs were to be used beyond this course, additional monitoring and validation procedures would be required and are outside the scope of the current work.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    "No direct users are affected by this class project; nonetheless, if interpretations or visualizations cause misinterpretation, we will correct and clarify our findings promptly in our documentation and public materials.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Not applicable because we are not deploying a production model.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "We recognize results could be misused to place individual accountability for structural health outcomes. To reduce misuse, we will provide clear context, document limitations, and emphasize structural determinants of health in our report.\n"

    "Planned milestone summary\n",
    "- Week-to-week rhythm: research/wrangling during weekdays, discuss progress and blockers at Tuesday 8 PM meetings, and assign concrete tasks for the following week.\n",
    "- Checkpoints:\n",
    "  - Data checkpoint: 2/17 (in-meeting review of cleaned and merged datasets)\n",
    "  - Analysis checkpoint: 2/24 (key analysis steps completed; draft figures)\n",
    "  - Final draft & video planning: 3/10\n",
    "  - Final submission & evaluations: 3/17\n",
    "- Responsibilities: we will assign owners for data wrangling, EDA, modeling, visualization, write-up, and the final video; owners will update status in the repo prior to each meeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Special resources / training needed\n",
    "- No special external tools beyond Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib/seaborn, scikit-learn/statsmodels) and Jupyter notebooks are required. If we use wearable/device study data requiring special access, one member will handle the data-access request process and document required approvals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication & conflict resolution\n",
    "- Primary channels: iMessage for daily coordination; FaceTime for weekly meetings; GitHub issues and PRs for code review and task tracking.\n",
    "- If conflicts arise, raise the issue in the group chat and bring it to the next FaceTime meeting; if urgent, schedule a short ad-hoc FaceTime. Decisions use majority vote (3 of 5) except for project topic selection which requires unanimity."
