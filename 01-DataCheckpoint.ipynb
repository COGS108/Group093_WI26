    "Health outcomes vary across the United States and are influenced by a combination of biological and lifestyle factors. Conditions like diabetes, obesity, and mental health are not attributed to a single cause. Factors like genetics, medical conditions, access to healthcare and the daily routine of an individual all play a role. One thing we can say about is that physical activity is one of the factors that can easily improve such conditions when time is dedicated to it weekly, and our goal is to examine how physical activity is associated with adult obesity prevalence, diabetes prevalence, and mental health across the U.S.\n",
    "Physical activity plays an important role in maintaining both physical and mental health and it is recognized as an important health factor. Physical activity includes everyday movements such as walking, running, stretching, or even having a structured workout. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), individuals should engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate to intense physical activity per week to support health outcomes <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">1</a>. Despite the recommendations from this organization, the amount of time or levels of physical activity varies across the individuals in the U.S. due to the differences they have in their work schedules, access to resources, and personal life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous research has shown a beneficial relationship between higher levels of physical activity and lower prevalence of obesity and diabetes. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that obesity and diabetes prevalence have steadily increased across the U.S. over the past decades<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a><a href=\"#cite_note-2\"> 2</a>. We noticed that these trends are influenced by a variety of factors which include diet quality, limited physical activity, metabolic conditions like thyroid conditions, or even the individual's metabolism. However, in this project, we focus on physical activity as the key variable and examine how it is associated with obesity and diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving along with physical health, there is also prior work that examined the relationship between physical activity and mental health outcomes. Research from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that even modest amounts of physical activity, such as 15 minutes of exercise per day or even one hour of walking, are associated with reduced risk of major depression and improved overall mental health outcomes<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a><a href=\"#cite_note-3\"> 3</a>. This supports the inclusion of mental health as an outcome variable in our project, along with obesity and diabetes when we examine how physical activity varies across the U.S.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our group has noticed that the existing research focuses more on the mental and health benefits for an individual. Our goal is to show how physical activity helps in a broader geographic level which is in the U.S. The differences in physical activity rates across the states may help explain the observed variation in obesity prevalence, diabetes prevalence and mental health indicators. This project aims to identify patterns that may help inform public health strategies and highlight the disparities in health and mental outcomes related to physical activity.\n",

    "We predict a strong negative correlation between minutes of intentional exercise and obesity rates and diabetes diagnosis rates among U.S. adults. We also predict that higher minutes of exercise will be positively correlated with improved self-reported mental health outcomes. Additionally, we further hypothesize that these relationships will vary by factors such as age and gender. Specifically, we predict that men between the ages 18 and 30 have higher weekly intentional exercise minutes per week and correspondingly lower obesity and diabetes rates, which will be positively correlated with self-reported mental health outcomes. In contrast, we also predict that women aged 40 and older will have lower amounts of weekly intentional exercise minutes and higher obesity and diabetes rates, which will be negatively correlated with self-reported mental health outcomes."

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them.

This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.

    "### Physical Activity and its connection with Mental Health outcomes for individuals in the U.S.\n",
    "Within this dataset it contains each individual level information such as, lifestyle behaviors, physical activity habits, and self reports on their own mental health. The key physical metrics in this dataset are Daily_Steps, which is the average number of steps per day, Exercise_duaration which is average duration per session in minutes, and Exercise_frequency which is days per week the person exercises (0-7). By using the above variables, the total number of minutes participants exercised during a week may be determined, and total exercise time can be compared with recommended exercise levels by public health organizations for adults, such as the health department recommends at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity for adults. The life style variables include Sleep_Hours which is the average sleep per night in hours, Screen_Time_Hours which is the screen time per day (non-work screen use), Diet_Quality which is a self rated diet quality (1=poor, 5=excellent), and finally Social_Interaction which is the number of meaningful social interactions per week. Metrics like those listed above are important indicators of your overall health, and how healthy you are physically and mentally. Also to help provide context when interpreting exercise effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mental health within the dataset is measured using a self-reported scale from 1-10. The four self-reported mental health measurements are: Stress_Level, Anxiety_Level, Depression_Level, and Happiness_Level, where at 10 represents the highest intensity of the condition. The dataset also includes a calculated Mental_Health_Score, defined as (Happiness × 2) − ((Stress + Anxiety + Depression) / 3). This composite score is an attempt to capture overall well-being by giving more weight to happiness and subtracting the mean of negative emotional experiences. Positive values indicate better mental health, and negative values indicate poorer well-being.But these ratings are still subjective, and are not clinically validated or diagnosed. So the data should just be interpreted as just simple indicators rather than a proven medical diagnosis. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the dataset there are several concerns that we as a group have noticed. Within the dataset the sample size is relatively pretty small (300 participants), which limits generalizability. This also causes a concern because the conclusions are meant to represent the broader U.S. adult population. There's uncertainty regarding how participants were chosen ( randomly chosen,or  through volunteer participation), and therefore, there is a possibility of sampling bias. Participants willing to share their health and fitness data may be more inclined to stay healthy, may have greater access to technology, and different socioeconomic status than people in the general population.Moreover, a considerable percentage of the variables obtained from participants are self-reported, which presents the potential for recall bias and social desirability bias. Additionally, given that the data set author developed their own scale for measuring mental health outcomes without validation, there are valid concerns that the subsequent data collected as a result of this measure may lack reliable measurement. Due to these issues, it would be good to use findings generated from this dataset in an exploratory correlational manner as opposed to being used definitively or as demonstrating causal.\n"

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    "- [x] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not use any human-subject interaction or individual-level data for this project, thus no informed consent is required. All analysis is performed at aggregated (U.S. state) level using publicly available, non-interactive data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have acknowledged that the underlying datasets may reflect collection and survey biases (e.g., nonresponse, sampling bias). We will document known limitations of each dataset and avoid over-interpreting state-level aggregates where collection bias may distort the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets used are at the state-aggregate level and contain no personally identifiable information. We will not attempt to merge data in ways that could reconstruct individual identities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some data sources include demographic variables that allow subgroup comparisons. While our primary analysis is state-level, we recognize that aggregation can conceal disparities. We will note these limitations and, where possible, examine demographic breakdowns to identify patterns that aggregate measures might hide.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    "- [x] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "All datasets are publicly available and non-sensitive, but we will store copies on password-protected personal and institutional systems and follow standard security practices to reduce risk of unauthorized access.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    "No individual-level personal data are collected or stored. Because no PII is used, a right-to-be-forgotten mechanism is not required; nevertheless, we will delete any derived files if requested and as described in our retention plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not plan to retain the project beyond the course. All project files and data will be deleted after the course concludes, unless the team agrees to preserve a cleaned, anonymized copy for future educational purposes and documents that decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    "- [x] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "We acknowledge that state-level analyses miss local and marginalized perspectives. We will explicitly call out these blindspots in our write-up and interpret findings conservatively, avoiding claims about individual-level causation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will examine missingness patterns, consistency across states, and known survey biases (e.g., recall bias, social desirability) and document these issues. Where feasible, we will avoid analyses that amplify biased signals and will be transparent about remaining biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "All visualizations and statistics will be produced to accurately reflect the data and the uncertainty in estimates; we will include appropriate labels, scales, and caveats so readers are not misled.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "No PII will be used or displayed in any analysis or figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will document all data cleaning, merging, and analysis steps and provide code and notes to enable reproducibility and auditing of our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    "- [x] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "We considered whether physical activity and health outcomes could act as proxies for socioeconomic status or access to care and will interpret associations cautiously, avoiding language that blames individuals or states for structural disparities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because our analysis is at the state-aggregate level, fairness testing across individual demographic groups is limited. Where subgroup data are available, we will report descriptive comparisons and caveat the limitations of such comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have not defined modeling metrics for a deployed decision system; this item is not applicable for our current exploratory/state-level analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Not applicable for a deployed decision model; we will, however, ensure that any statistical models used are interpretable and that we explain key relationships in plain language.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explicitly communicate limitations of our analysis and potential biases in the report and presentation to avoid overgeneralization or misuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    "- [x] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is exploratory and not intended for deployment in decision-making. If outputs were to be used beyond this course, additional monitoring and validation procedures would be required and are outside the scope of the current work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results?\n",
    "\n",
    "No direct users are affected by this class project; nonetheless, if interpretations or visualizations cause misinterpretation, we will correct and clarify our findings promptly in our documentation and public materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Not applicable because we are not deploying a production model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "We recognize results could be misused to place individual accountability for structural health outcomes. To reduce misuse, we will provide clear context, document limitations, and emphasize structural determinants of health in our report."

    "Team Expectation 6 — Handling Struggles and Deadlines\n",
    "- If a member struggles to complete their assigned work, they should notify the group as soon as possible via text.\n",
    "- When time allows, teammates will help. If we face a tight deadline, we will reassign the task to ensure the project stays on schedule.\n",
    "- Reassigning work is a last-resort solution to avoid falling behind; we aim to distribute work fairly and support members early.\n",
    "\n",
    "Team Expectation 7 — Accessibility of Expectations\n",
    "- We have pasted these expectations into our group text chat and shared them as a file so every member can refer to them throughout the quarter."
